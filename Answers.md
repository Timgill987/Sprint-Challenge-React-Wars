1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React works hard to fix the organization and compartmentalization of code to be easier to read. a good analogy would be that it allows you to view working pieces of code as reusable legos that you clip together to make one or many working programs. 

1. What does it mean to think in react?

Think in infinite legos?

1. Describe state.

State as I view it is the react way to set a main vairiable for the big data that is eventually rendered to a page. 

1. Describe props.

props are essentially parameters that are passed between component js files. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

They let you use state and react features without writing a class. useEffect works within functions.
